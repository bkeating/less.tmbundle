# LESS TextMate Bundle - Syntax support for LESS (.less) CSS files.

This Bundle gives you syntax support (highlighting/recognition) for the LESS 
dynamic stylesheet language. Nothing more. It's a stripped down version of 
[appden](https://github.com/appden) & [rsms](https://github.com/rsms)'s 
[less.tmbundle](https://github.com/appden/less.tmbundle). If you plan to use
the ruby gem use their repository instead of this one.

### No compiling support... Get off my lawn!

There are a few ways to use LESS in your projects and they all seem to fit into 
one of two categories;

*  **On demand** - [Client side](http://lesscss.org/#-client-side-usage) in the
   browser or [Server side](http://lesscss.org/#-server-side-usage) using 
   [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/).
   
*  **Pre-compiled** - Using a Ruby Gem (``sudo gem install less``) 
   or [Less.app](http://incident57.com/less/) on the desktop.

The original version of this bundle assumes you use the ruby gem and so every 
time you save a file it will compile the CSS or error out if you don't have the 
gem installed. I don't want to use the ruby gem. I use Less.app. I also noticed 
that while saving large files via the ruby gem equipped bundle, it would lock 
up my TextMate session until the CSS compilation was complete. By using my 
simple bundle and an external compiler such as Less.app you get rid of that 
lock up. You save time. You keep it gangsta.
